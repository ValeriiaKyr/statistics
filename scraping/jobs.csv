Dzięki eDiscovery miliony (a czasami dziesiątki milionów) plików na wejściu zamieniają się w kilkanaście lub kilkadziesiąt tych najważniejszych znalezionych dokumentów. Po drodze są eksportowane, normalizowane, oczyszczane, przekształcane, indeksowane, przeszukiwane, przeglądane i finalnie wykorzystywane jako dowody np. w postępowaniach wewnętrznych czy sądowych.,Dzięki eDiscovery udaje się wykryć nadużycia i nieprawidłowości, oraz zebrać dowody przeciwko osobom, które się ich dopuściły.
